## Data

Write a function in the programming language of your choice to solve the following problems.
Each function MUST be accompanied by positive and negative unit tests.
	i. Given an array with 1,000,000 integers between 1 and 1,000,000, one integer is in the array twice. Find the duplicate.
	ii. Find the first non­repeating character in a string: ("DEFD" ­> E)


## Getting Started

You will require ruby and bundler to be installed to run through this exercise. Once installed, ensure the dependencies are installed by running `bundle`.

Once installed, you should be able to run the following commands:

- `bundle exec rake`  : Runs the application and prints the output to the terminal
- `bundle exec rspec` : Runs the test suite; there are some integration specs to get you started, but you'll probably want to add more as you work
